/**
 * 此类是具有以下不变量的共享资源的警卫。多个客户端可以通过 {@link #acquireResource()} 调用并行获取资源。作为调用的
 * 结果，每个客户都会获得一个 {@link Lease}。租约的 {@link #close()} 方法释放资源并减少 {@link ResourceGuard}
 * 对象中的客户端数量。受保护的资源只能在相应的资源守卫成功关闭后才被释放，但只有在所有获得受保护资源租用的客户端都已释放
 * 该受保护资源后，才能关闭守卫。在这发生之前，对 {@link #close()} 的调用将被阻塞，直到触发零开放租赁条件。资源守卫关
 * 闭后，对 {@link #acquireResource()} 的调用将失败并出现异常。请注意，显然客户端有责任在使用后释放资源。所有客户端
 * 都被认为是平等的，即只有一个全局计数维护了资源被获取的次数，而不是由谁获取。
 *
 * This class is a guard for shared resources with the following invariants. The resource can be
 * acquired by multiple clients in parallel through the {@link #acquireResource()} call. As a result
 * of the call, each client gets a {@link Lease}. The {@link #close()} method of the lease releases
 * the resources and reduces the client count in the {@link ResourceGuard} object. The protected
 * resource should only be disposed once the corresponding resource guard is successfully closed,
 * but the guard can only be closed once all clients that acquired a lease for the guarded resource
 * have released it. Before this is happened, the call to {@link #close()} will block until the
 * zero-open-leases condition is triggered. After the resource guard is closed, calls to {@link
 * #acquireResource()} will fail with exception. Notice that, obviously clients are responsible to
 * release the resource after usage. All clients are considered equal, i.e. there is only a global
 * count maintained how many times the resource was acquired but not by whom.
