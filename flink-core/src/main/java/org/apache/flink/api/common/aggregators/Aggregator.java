/**
 * 聚合器是一种跨函数的并行实例聚合值的方法。聚合器收集关于在函数中执行的实际工作的简单统计信息(例如处理元素的数量)。
 * 聚合器是特定于迭代的，通常通过使用{@link ConvergenceCriterion}来检查迭代的收敛性。与{@link}(其结果在作业结束时可用)相反，
 * 聚合器在每个迭代超步中计算一次。它们的值可以用于检查收敛性(在迭代超步的末尾)，并且可以在下一个迭代超步中访问。
 * <p>聚合器必须在通过函数使用它们的迭代处注册。在Java API中，当将聚合器和收敛准则一起使用时，方法是“IterativeDataSet.registerAggregator(…)”
 * 或“IterativeDataSet.registerAggregationConvergenceCriterion(…)”。聚合器总是在一个名称下注册。
 * 该名称可用于在运行时从函数内部访问聚合器。下面的代码片段显示了一个典型的情况。这里，它在所有并行实例中计算一个函数过滤掉了多少个元素。
 *
 * Aggregators are a means of aggregating values across parallel instances of a function.
 * Aggregators collect simple statistics (such as the number of processed elements) about the actual
 * work performed in a function. Aggregators are specific to iterations and are commonly used to
 * check the convergence of an iteration by using a {@link ConvergenceCriterion}. In contrast to the
 * {@link org.apache.flink.api.common.accumulators.Accumulator} (whose result is available at the
 * end of a job, the aggregators are computed once per iteration superstep. Their value can be used
 * to check for convergence (at the end of the iteration superstep) and it can be accessed in the
 * next iteration superstep.
 *
 * <p>Aggregators must be registered at the iteration inside which they are used via the function.
 * In the Java API, the method is "IterativeDataSet.registerAggregator(...)" or
 * "IterativeDataSet.registerAggregationConvergenceCriterion(...)" when using the aggregator
 * together with a convergence criterion. Aggregators are always registered under a name. That name
 * can be used to access the aggregator at runtime from within a function. The following code
 * snippet shows a typical case. Here, it count across all parallel instances how many elements are
 * filtered out by a function.
 *
 * <pre>
 * // the user-defined function
 * public class MyFilter extends FilterFunction&lt;Double&gt; {
 *     private LongSumAggregator agg;
 *
 *     public void open(Configuration parameters) {
 *         agg = getIterationRuntimeContext().getIterationAggregator("numFiltered");
 *     }
 *
 *     public boolean filter (Double value) {
 *         if (value &gt; 1000000.0) {
 *             agg.aggregate(1);
 *             return false
 *         }
 *
 *         return true;
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * // the iteration where the aggregator is registered
 * IterativeDataSet&lt;Double&gt; iteration = input.iterate(100).registerAggregator("numFiltered", LongSumAggregator.class);
 * ...
 * DataSet&lt;Double&gt; filtered = someIntermediateResult.filter(new MyFilter);
 * ...
 * DataSet&lt;Double&gt; result = iteration.closeWith(filtered);
 * ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Aggregators must be <i>distributive</i>: An aggregator must be able to pre-aggregate values
 * and it must be able to aggregate these pre-aggregated values to form the final aggregate. Many
 * aggregation functions fulfill this condition (sum, min, max) and others can be brought into that
 * form: One can expressing <i>count</i> as a sum over values of one, and one can express
 * <i>average</i> through a sum and a count.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the aggregated value.
